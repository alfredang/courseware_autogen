    "Interactive Presentation": "Interactive presentations are essential for introducing complex technical concepts and frameworks. This method allows for real-time visualization of algorithms, architectures, and mathematical concepts through slides and interactive demonstrations. The interactive nature enables learners to engage with the material actively, ask questions, and gain immediate clarification on challenging concepts. This approach is particularly effective for explaining abstract concepts while maintaining learner engagement through regular interaction.",
    "Demonstration": "Demonstrations are crucial for showing practical implementation of models and techniques. Through live coding and step-by-step walkthroughs, learners can observe best practices in action and understand the practical application of theoretical concepts. This method is particularly valuable for showcasing how to implement different architectures, handle data preprocessing, and execute model training workflows. Demonstrations help bridge the gap between theory and practical application by providing visual and concrete examples of implementation techniques.",
    "Practical": "Hands-on practical sessions are essential for developing implementation skills and building confidence in working with models and frameworks. These sessions allow learners to directly apply theoretical knowledge by working with actual datasets, implementing models, and solving real-world problems. Through guided exercises and independent work, learners can experiment with different approaches, debug issues, and understand the nuances of implementation. This experiential learning approach helps solidify understanding and builds practical competency in applying complex techniques."
