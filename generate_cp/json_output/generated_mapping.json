        "SkillsFuture's report Skills Demand For The Future Economy (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport) published in 2025, spotlights the priority skills and jobs in demand in three specially selected, emerging, high-growth areas. This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore's key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of 'priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual's long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill's applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\nThe industry is currently facing several challenges and performance gaps that are directly related to the integration and effective use of advanced digital tools and technologies. One of the primary challenges is the rapid pace of technological advancement, which often outpaces the ability of organizations to adapt and integrate these new tools into their existing systems. This is particularly true for tools like Microsoft Copilot, which leverage artificial intelligence to enhance productivity and efficiency. Many organizations struggle with the transition from traditional systems to more advanced, AI-driven solutions, leading to disruptions in workflow and productivity. Additionally, there is often a lack of understanding and expertise in effectively utilizing these tools to their full potential, which can result in underutilization and missed opportunities for optimization. Another significant gap is the resistance to change within organizations, where employees may be hesitant or lack the motivation to adopt new technologies, further hindering the transition process. These challenges highlight the need for comprehensive training programs that not only focus on the technical aspects of these tools but also address the human factors involved in technology adoption.\n\nTo effectively address the challenges and performance gaps identified, there is a critical need for targeted training programs that focus on both the technical and human aspects of technology adoption. Training should be designed to equip employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to smoothly transition to new systems, such as Microsoft Copilot, and to effectively utilize these tools to enhance organizational processes. This includes training on the relevant systems and software, understanding the organization's processes, and the systems transition process. Additionally, training should focus on emerging technological trends, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotic process automation, to ensure that employees are not only able to use current tools effectively but are also prepared for future technological advancements. Furthermore, training programs should incorporate strategies for overcoming resistance to change, such as fostering a culture of innovation and continuous learning, and providing support and resources to help employees adapt to new technologies. By addressing both the technical and human factors, training can play a crucial role in bridging the performance gaps and enabling organizations to fully leverage the benefits of advanced digital tools.\n\nSeveral job roles within the industry would significantly benefit from training on crafting effective prompts for tools like Microsoft Copilot. These roles include IT professionals, who are responsible for managing and implementing new technologies within the organization. Training would enable them to better understand the capabilities and limitations of AI-driven tools, and to develop strategies for integrating these tools into existing systems. Additionally, roles such as business analysts and data analysts would benefit from training, as it would enhance their ability to leverage AI tools for data analysis and decision-making processes. Furthermore, roles in project management and operations would also benefit, as training would equip them with the skills to plan and manage the transition to new systems, and to optimize workflows and processes using advanced digital tools. Finally, training would be beneficial for roles in human resources and organizational development, as it would enable them to develop and implement strategies for fostering a culture of innovation and continuous learning, and to support employees in adapting to new technologies. By targeting these key roles, training can have a significant impact on the overall performance and productivity of the organization."
