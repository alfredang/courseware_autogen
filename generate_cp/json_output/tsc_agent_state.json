This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore\u2019s key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of \u2018priority skills which are highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual\u2019s long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill\u2019s applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \\n\\nIn the tourism industry, the landscape of marketing has shifted dramatically with the advent of social e-commerce platforms like XiaoHongShu (Little Red Book). One of the prominent challenges faced by the industry is adapting to the rapidly changing digital environment. Traditional marketing strategies may no longer yield the desired results as consumers increasingly turn to social media for travel inspiration and recommendations. Additionally, there's a growing need to engage with potential travellers authentically and creatively amidst stiff competition. Performance gaps arise due to a lack of proficiency in leveraging platforms like XiaoHongShu effectively, resulting in missed opportunities to reach and engage with target audiences.\\nTo address the performance gaps prevalent in the tourism industry, training programs focusing on creating engaging social e-commerce campaigns on platforms like XiaoHongShu are essential. These programs should equip professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the intricacies of social media marketing in the context of tourism. Training modules should cover areas such as content creation tailored to the platform's audience, understanding consumer behaviour on social e-commerce platforms, utilizing influencers for effective promotion, and leveraging analytics for campaign optimization. Practical hands-on exercises and case studies can provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of how to develop and execute successful campaigns.\\nThe targeted job roles for this training would include marketing managers, digital marketing specialists, social media managers, and content creators within the tourism industry. These professionals are responsible for conceptualizing, implementing, and monitoring marketing campaigns aimed at attracting travellers.\"], [\"Performance gaps that the course will address.

This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore\u2019s key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of \u2018priority skills which are highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual\u2019s long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill\u2019s applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \\n\\nIn the tourism industry, the landscape of marketing has shifted dramatically with the advent of social e-commerce platforms like XiaoHongShu (Little Red Book). One of the prominent challenges faced by the industry is adapting to the rapidly changing digital environment. Traditional marketing strategies may no longer yield the desired results as consumers increasingly turn to social media for travel inspiration and recommendations. Additionally, there's a growing need to engage with potential travellers authentically and creatively amidst stiff competition. Performance gaps arise due to a lack of proficiency in leveraging platforms like XiaoHongShu effectively, resulting in missed opportunities to reach and engage with target audiences.\\nTo address the performance gaps prevalent in the tourism industry, training programs focusing on creating engaging social e-commerce campaigns on platforms like XiaoHongShu are essential. These programs should equip professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the intricacies of social media marketing in the context of tourism. Training modules should cover areas such as content creation tailored to the platform's audience, understanding consumer behaviour on social e-commerce platforms, utilizing influencers for effective promotion, and leveraging analytics for campaign optimization. Practical hands-on exercises and case studies can provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of how to develop and execute successful campaigns.\\nThe targeted job roles for this training would include marketing managers, digital marketing specialists, social media managers, and content creators within the tourism industry. These professionals are responsible for conceptualizing, implementing, and monitoring marketing campaigns aimed at attracting travellers.\"], [\"Performance gaps that the course will address.
