        "SkillsFuture's report Skills Demand For The Future Economy (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport) published in 2025, spotlights the priority skills and jobs in demand in three specially selected, emerging, high-growth areas. This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore's key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of 'priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual's long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill's applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\nThe industry currently faces significant challenges in effectively implementing and optimizing advanced AI technologies within existing workflows and systems. Organizations struggle with the complexity of developing and fine-tuning AI models that can meet specific business requirements while maintaining quality and reliability. Technical teams often lack the comprehensive understanding needed to properly preprocess data, select appropriate model architectures, and implement effective training strategies. This has resulted in suboptimal model performance, increased development costs, and longer time-to-market for AI-powered solutions. Additionally, many organizations face difficulties in maintaining and improving their AI models over time, leading to degraded performance and reliability issues. The rapid evolution of AI technologies also means that many existing professionals lack the updated skills needed to work with modern frameworks and methodologies, creating a significant skills gap in the workforce.\n\nTo address these critical performance gaps, professionals in the industry require comprehensive training in both theoretical foundations and practical implementation aspects of AI model development. There is a pressing need for hands-on experience with current machine learning libraries, deep learning algorithms, and model optimization techniques. Professionals need to develop strong capabilities in data preprocessing, including understanding various data formats, cleaning methodologies, and transformation techniques. Training must cover advanced topics such as neural network architecture selection, parallel training implementations, and performance optimization strategies. Furthermore, there is a crucial need for developing skills in model evaluation and fine-tuning, enabling professionals to identify and address model limitations effectively. The training should emphasize practical application through real-world scenarios, allowing participants to gain experience with industry-standard tools and frameworks while developing problem-solving capabilities.\n\nThis specialized training would be particularly beneficial for several key roles within the industry. Machine Learning Engineers and AI Developers would gain essential skills for implementing and optimizing AI models in production environments. Data Scientists would benefit from enhanced capabilities in model development and fine-tuning, enabling them to create more effective solutions for complex business problems. Software Engineers transitioning into AI development roles would acquire the fundamental knowledge and practical skills needed for this specialization. Technical Team Leaders and AI Project Managers would develop a deeper understanding of the technical considerations and challenges involved in AI implementation, enabling better project planning and resource allocation. Additionally, Research Engineers and AI Specialists would benefit from updated knowledge of current methodologies and best practices in model development and optimization, enhancing their ability to drive innovation in their organizations."
