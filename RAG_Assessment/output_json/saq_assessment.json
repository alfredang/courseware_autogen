You can work with local files, connect your repository to others over a network, and work effectively with others. But the story doesn\u2019t end there; Git is usually used as part of a larger ecosystem, and the terminal isn\u2019t always the best way to work with it. Now we\u2019ll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments where Git can be useful, and how other applications (including yours) work alongside Git.\n\n# Graphical Interfaces\n\nGit\u2019s native environment is in the terminal. New features show up there first, and only at the command line is the full power of Git completely at your disposal. But plain text isn\u2019t the best choice for all tasks; sometimes a visual representation is what you need, and some users are much more comfortable with a point-and-click interface.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that different interfaces are tailored for different workflows. Some clients expose only a carefully curated subset of Git functionality, in order to support a specific way of working that the author considers effective. When viewed in this light, none of these tools can be called \u201cbetter\u201d than any of the others, they\u2019re simply more fit for their intended purpose. Also note that there\u2019s nothing these graphical clients can do that the command-line client can\u2019t; the command-line is still where you\u2019ll have the most power and control when working with your repositories.\n\n# gitk and git-gui\n\nWhen you install Git, you also get its visual tools, gitk and git-gui.\n\ngitk is a graphical history viewer. Think of it like a powerful GUI shell over git log and git grep. This is the tool to use when you\u2019re trying to find something that happened in the past, or visualize your project\u2019s history.\n\nGitk is easiest to invoke from the command-line. Just cd into a Git repository, and type:\n\n$ gitk [git log options]\nGitk accepts many command-line options, most of which are passed through to the underlying git log action. Probably one of the most useful is the --all flag, which tells gitk to show commits reachable from any ref, not just HEAD. Gitk\u2019s interface looks like this:",

However, this leaves us with examples of usage of the commands somewhat scattered throughout the whole book.\n\nIn this appendix, we\u2019ll go through all the Git commands we addressed throughout the book, grouped roughly by what they\u2019re used for. We\u2019ll talk about what each command very generally does and then point out where in the book you can find us having used it.\n\nYou can abbreviate long options. For example, you can type in git commit --a, which acts as if you typed git commit --amend. This only works when the letters after -- are unique for one option. Do use the full option when writing scripts.\n\n# Setup and Config\n\nThere are two commands that are used quite a lot, from the first invocations of Git to common everyday tweaking and referencing, the config and help commands.\n\n# git config\n\nGit has a default way of doing hundreds of things. For a lot of these things, you can tell Git to default to doing them a different way, or set your preferences. This involves everything from telling Git what your name is to specific terminal color preferences or what editor you use. There are several files this command will read from and write to so you can set values globally or down to specific repositories.\n\nThe git config command has been used in nearly every chapter of the book.\n\n- In First-Time Git Setup we used it to specify our name, email address and editor preference before we even got started using Git.\n- In Git Aliases we showed how you could use it to create shorthand commands that expand to long option sequences so you don\u2019t have to type them every time.\n- In Rebasing we used it to make --rebase the default when you run git pull.\n- In Credential Storage we used it to set up a default store for your HTTP passwords.\n- In Keyword Expansion we showed how to set up smudge and clean filters on content coming in and out of Git.\n- Finally, basically the entirety of Git Configuration is dedicated to the command.\n\n# git config core.editor commands\n\nAccompanying the configuration instructions in Your Editor, many editors can be set as follows:",

Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from version-control features, and Git\u2019s model works very well for many different scenarios.\n\nIf you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially two options: spawn a shell and call the git command-line program, or embed a Git library into your application. Here we\u2019ll cover command-line integration and several of the most popular embeddable Git libraries.\n\n# Command-line Git\n\nOne option is to spawn a shell process and use the Git command-line tool to do the work. This has the benefit of being canonical, and all of Git\u2019s features are supported. This also happens to be fairly easy, as most runtime environments have a relatively simple facility for invoking a process with command-line arguments. However, this approach does have some downsides.\n\nOne is that all the output is in plain text. This means that you\u2019ll have to parse Git\u2019s occasionally-changing output format to read progress and result information, which can be inefficient and error-prone.\n\nAnother is the lack of error recovery. If a repository is corrupted somehow, or the user has a malformed configuration value, Git will simply refuse to perform many operations.\n\nYet another is process management. Git requires you to maintain a shell environment on a separate process, which can add unwanted complexity. Trying to coordinate many of these processes (especially when potentially accessing the same repository from several processes) can be quite a challenge.\n\n# Libgit2\n\nAnother option at your disposal is to use Libgit2. Libgit2 is a dependency-free implementation of Git, with a focus on having a nice API for use within other programs. You can find it at https://libgit2.org.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at what the C API looks like. Here\u2019s a whirlwind tour:\n\n// Open a repository\ngit_repository *repo;\nint error = git_repository_open(&repo, \"/path/to/repository\");\n// Dereference HEAD to a commit\ngit_object *head_commit;\nerror = git_revparse_single(&head_commit, repo, \"HEAD^{commit}\");\ngit_commit *commit = (git_commit*)head_commit;",

In this chapter, we\u2019ll see how you can make Git operate in a more customized fashion, by introducing several important configuration settings and the hooks system. With these tools, it\u2019s easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or your group needs it to.\n\n# Git Configuration\n\nAs you read briefly in Getting Started, you can specify Git configuration settings with the git config command. One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:\n\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n\nNow you\u2019ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize your Git usage.\n\nFirst, a quick review: Git uses a series of configuration files to determine non-default behavior that you may want. The first place Git looks for these values is in the system-wide [path]/etc/gitconfig file, which contains settings that are applied to every user on the system and all of their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\n\nThe next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig (or ~/.config/git/config) file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the --global option.\n\nFinally, Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you\u2019re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository, and represent passing the --local option to git config. If you don\u2019t specify which level you want to work with, this is the default.\n\nEach of these \u201clevels\u201d (system, global, local) overwrites values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig, for instance.\n\nGit\u2019s configuration files are plain-text, so you can also set these values by manually editing the file and inserting the correct syntax. It\u2019s generally easier to run the git config command, though.\n\n# Basic Client Configuration\n\nThe configuration options recognized by Git fall into two categories: client-side and server-side. The majority of the options are client-side \u2014 configuring your personal working preferences. Many, many configuration options are supported, but a large fraction of them are useful only in certain edge cases; we\u2019ll cover just the most common and useful options here.

The description file is used only by the GitWeb program, so don\u2019t worry about it. The config file contains your project-specific configuration options, and the info directory keeps a global exclude file for ignored patterns that you don\u2019t want to track in a .gitignore file. The hooks directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts, which are discussed in detail in Git Hooks.\n\nThis leaves four important entries: the HEAD and (yet to be created) index files, and the objects and refs directories. These are the core parts of Git. The objects directory stores all the content for your database, the refs directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more), the HEAD file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the index file is where Git stores your staging area information. You\u2019ll now look at each of these sections in detail to see how Git operates.\n\n# Git Objects\n\nGit is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.\n\nAs a demonstration, let\u2019s look at the plumbing command git hash-object, which takes some data, stores it in your .git/objects directory (the object database), and gives you back the unique key that now refers to that data object.\n\nFirst, you initialize a new Git repository and verify that there is (predictably) nothing in the objects directory:\n\n$ git init test\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/\n$ cd test\n$ find .git/objects\n.git/objects\n.git/objects/info\n.git/objects/pack\n$ find .git/objects -type f\nGit has initialized the objects directory and created pack and info subdirectories in it, but there are no regular files. Now, let\u2019s use git hash-object to create a new data object and manually store it in your new Git database:\n\n$ echo 'test content' | git hash-object -w --stdin",

These variables can be stored in three different places:\n\n1. [path]/etc/gitconfig file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.\n2. ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the --global option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on your system.\n3. config file in the Git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever repository you\u2019re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the --local option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.\n\nEach level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig.\n\nOn Windows systems, Git looks for the .gitconfig file in the $HOME directory (C:\\Users\\$USER for most people). It also still looks for [path]/etc/gitconfig, although it\u2019s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer. If you are using version 2.x or later of Git for Windows, there is also a system-level config file at C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Git\\config on Windows XP, and in",

In this chapter, we\u2019ll see how you can make Git operate in a more customized fashion, by introducing several important configuration settings and the hooks system. With these tools, it\u2019s easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or your group needs it to.\n\n# Git Configuration\n\nAs you read briefly in Getting Started, you can specify Git configuration settings with the git config command. One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:\n\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n\nNow you\u2019ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize your Git usage.\n\nFirst, a quick review: Git uses a series of configuration files to determine non-default behavior that you may want. The first place Git looks for these values is in the system-wide [path]/etc/gitconfig file, which contains settings that are applied to every user on the system and all of their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\n\nThe next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig (or ~/.config/git/config) file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the --global option.\n\nFinally, Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you\u2019re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository, and represent passing the --local option to git config. If you don\u2019t specify which level you want to work with, this is the default.\n\nEach of these \u201clevels\u201d (system, global, local) overwrites values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig, for instance.\n\nGit\u2019s configuration files are plain-text, so you can also set these values by manually editing the file and inserting the correct syntax. It\u2019s generally easier to run the git config command, though.\n\n# Basic Client Configuration\n\nThe configuration options recognized by Git fall into two categories: client-side and server-side. The majority of the options are client-side \u2014 configuring your personal working preferences. Many, many configuration options are supported, but a large fraction of them are useful only in certain edge cases; we\u2019ll cover just the most common and useful options here. If you want to see a list of all the options your version of Git recognizes, you can run:",

The description file is used only by the GitWeb program, so don\u2019t worry about it. The config file contains your project-specific configuration options, and the info directory keeps a global exclude file for ignored patterns that you don\u2019t want to track in a .gitignore file. The hooks directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts, which are discussed in detail in Git Hooks.\n\nThis leaves four important entries: the HEAD and (yet to be created) index files, and the objects and refs directories. These are the core parts of Git. The objects directory stores all the content for your database, the refs directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more), the HEAD file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the index file is where Git stores your staging area information. You\u2019ll now look at each of these sections in detail to see how Git operates.\n\n# Git Objects\n\nGit is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.\n\nAs a demonstration, let\u2019s look at the plumbing command git hash-object, which takes some data, stores it in your .git/objects directory (the object database), and gives you back the unique key that now refers to that data object.\n\nFirst, you initialize a new Git repository and verify that there is (predictably) nothing in the objects directory:\n\n$ git init test\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/\n$ cd test\n$ find .git/objects\n.git/objects\n.git/objects/info\n.git/objects/pack\n$ find .git/objects -type f\nGit has initialized the objects directory and created pack and info subdirectories in it, but there are no regular files. Now, let\u2019s use git hash-object to create a new data object and manually store it in your new Git database:\n\n$ echo 'test content' | git hash-object -w --stdin",

          "text": "# GitHub\n\nGitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things. So while it\u2019s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.\n\nThis chapter is about using GitHub effectively. We\u2019ll cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub\u2019s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.\n\nIf you are not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or to collaborate with other projects that are hosted on GitHub, you can safely skip to Git Tools.\n\n# Interfaces Change\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that like many active websites, the UI elements in these screenshots are bound to change over time. Hopefully the general idea of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here will still be there, but if you want more up to date versions of these screens, the online versions of this book may have newer screenshots.\n\n# Account Setup and Configuration\n\nThe first thing you need to do is set up a free user account. Simply visit https://github.com, choose a user name that isn\u2019t already taken, provide an email address and a password, and click the big green \u201cSign up for GitHub\u201d button.",

Unfortunately, git-p4 can\u2019t mix shallow clones and multiple branches; if you have a huge project and want to work on more than one branch, you\u2019ll have to git p4 clone once for each branch you want to submit to.\n\nFor creating or integrating branches, you\u2019ll have to use a Perforce client. Git-p4 can only sync and submit to existing branches, and it can only do it one linear changeset at a time. If you merge two branches in Git and try to submit the new changeset, all that will be recorded is a bunch of file changes; the metadata about which branches are involved in the integration will be lost.\n\n# Git and Perforce Summary\n\nGit-p4 makes it possible to use a Git workflow with a Perforce server, and it\u2019s pretty good at it. However, it\u2019s important to remember that Perforce is in charge of the source, and you\u2019re only using Git to work locally. Just be really careful about sharing Git commits; if you have a remote that other people use, don\u2019t push any commits that haven\u2019t already been submitted to the Perforce server.\n\nIf you want to freely mix the use of Perforce and Git as clients for source control, and you can convince the server administrator to install it, Git Fusion makes using Git a first-class version-control client for a Perforce server.\n\n# Migrating to Git\n\nIf you have an existing codebase in another VCS but you\u2019ve decided to start using Git, you must migrate your project one way or another. This section goes over some importers for common systems, and then demonstrates how to develop your own custom importer. You\u2019ll learn how to import data from several of the bigger professionally used SCM systems, because they make up the majority of users who are switching, and because high-quality tools for them are easy to come by.\n\n# Subversion\n\nIf you read the previous section about using git svn, you can easily use those instructions to git svn clone a repository; then, stop using the Subversion server, push to a new Git server, and start using that. If you want the history, you can accomplish that as quickly as you can pull the data out of the Subversion server (which may take a while).\n\nHowever, the import isn\u2019t perfect; and because it will take so long, you may as well do it right. The first problem is the author information. In Subversion, each person committing has a user on the system who is recorded in the commit information. The examples in the previous section show schacon in some places, such as the blame output and the git svn log. If you want to map this to better Git author data, you need a mapping from the Subversion users to the Git authors. Create a file called users.txt that has this mapping in a format like this:\n\nschacon = Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@geemail.com&gt;\nselse = Someo Nelse &lt;selse@geemail.com&gt;",

Probably the easiest is to use Maven \u2013 the integration is accomplished by adding the following snippet to the &lt;dependencies&gt; tag in your pom.xml file:\n\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.5.0.201409260305-r&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nThe version will most likely have advanced by the time you read this; check https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit for updated repository information. Once this step is done, Maven will automatically acquire and use the JGit libraries that you\u2019ll need.\n\nIf you would rather manage the binary dependencies yourself, pre-built JGit binaries are available from https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download. You can build them into your project by running a command like this:",

          "text": "# Git Internals\n\nYou may have skipped to this chapter from a much earlier chapter, or you may have gotten here after sequentially reading the entire book up to this point \u2014 in either case, this is where we\u2019ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. We found that understanding this information was fundamentally important to appreciating how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, we\u2019ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process. We leave it up to you to decide.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get started. First, if it isn\u2019t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You\u2019ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\n\nIn the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it\u2019s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.\n\nThe content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we\u2019ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you\u2019ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.\n\n# Plumbing and Porcelain\n\nThis book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as checkout, branch, remote, and so on. But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as Git\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called \u201cporcelain\u201d commands.\n\nAs you will have noticed by now, this book\u2019s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands. But in this chapter, you\u2019ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. Many of these commands aren\u2019t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.\n\nWhen you run git init in a new or existing directory, Git creates the .git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located. If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need. This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory. Here\u2019s what a newly-initialized .git directory typically looks like:\n\n$ ls -F1\nconfig\ndescription\nHEAD",
