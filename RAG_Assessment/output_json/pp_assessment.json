On Windows, the client includes a shortcut to launch PowerShell with Posh-git, which we\u2019ll talk more about later in this chapter.\n\nThe next step is to give the tool some repositories to work with. The client shows you a list of the repositories you have access to on GitHub, and can clone them in one step. If you already have a local repository, just drag its directory from the Finder or Windows Explorer into the GitHub client window, and it will be included in the list of repositories on the left.\n\n# Recommended Workflow\n\nOnce it\u2019s installed and configured, you can use the GitHub client for many common Git tasks. The intended workflow for this tool is sometimes called the \u201cGitHub Flow.\u201d We cover this in more detail in The GitHub Flow, but the general gist is that (a) you\u2019ll be committing to a branch, and (b) you\u2019ll be syncing up with a remote repository fairly regularly.\n\nBranch management is one of the areas where the two tools diverge. On macOS, there\u2019s a button at the top of the window for creating a new branch:\n\nFigure 181. \u201cCreate Branch\u201d button on macOS\n\nOn Windows, this is done by typing the new branch\u2019s name in the branch-switching widget:",

          "text": "# Git Internals\n\nYou may have skipped to this chapter from a much earlier chapter, or you may have gotten here after sequentially reading the entire book up to this point \u2014 in either case, this is where we\u2019ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. We found that understanding this information was fundamentally important to appreciating how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, we\u2019ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process. We leave it up to you to decide.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get started. First, if it isn\u2019t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You\u2019ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\n\nIn the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it\u2019s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.\n\nThe content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we\u2019ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you\u2019ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.\n\n# Plumbing and Porcelain\n\nThis book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as checkout, branch, remote, and so on. But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as Git\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called \u201cporcelain\u201d commands.\n\nAs you will have noticed by now, this book\u2019s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands. But in this chapter, you\u2019ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. Many of these commands aren\u2019t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.\n\nWhen you run git init in a new or existing directory, Git creates the .git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located. If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need. This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory. Here\u2019s what a newly-initialized .git directory typically looks like:\n\n$ ls -F1\nconfig\ndescription\nHEAD",

So while it\u2019s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.\n\nThis chapter is about using GitHub effectively.

Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from version-control features, and Git\u2019s model works very well for many different scenarios.\n\nIf you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially two options: spawn a shell and call the git command-line program, or embed a Git library into your application. Here we\u2019ll cover command-line integration and several of the most popular embeddable Git libraries.\n\n# Command-line Git\n\nOne option is to spawn a shell process and use the Git command-line tool to do the work. This has the benefit of being canonical, and all of Git\u2019s features are supported. This also happens to be fairly easy, as most runtime environments have a relatively simple facility for invoking a process with command-line arguments. However, this approach does have some downsides.\n\nOne is that all the output is in plain text. This means that you\u2019ll have to parse Git\u2019s occasionally-changing output format to read progress and result information, which can be inefficient and error-prone.\n\nAnother is the lack of error recovery. If a repository is corrupted somehow, or the user has a malformed configuration value, Git will simply refuse to perform many operations.\n\nYet another is process management. Git requires you to maintain a shell environment on a separate process, which can add unwanted complexity. Trying to coordinate many of these processes (especially when potentially accessing the same repository from several processes) can be quite a challenge.\n\n# Libgit2\n\nAnother option at your disposal is to use Libgit2. Libgit2 is a dependency-free implementation of Git, with a focus on having a nice API for use within other programs. You can find it at https://libgit2.org.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at what the C API looks like. Here\u2019s a whirlwind tour:\n\n// Open a repository\ngit_repository *repo;\nint error = git_repository_open(&repo, \"/path/to/repository\");\n// Dereference HEAD to a commit\ngit_object *head_commit;\nerror = git_revparse_single(&head_commit, repo, \"HEAD^{commit}\");\ngit_commit *commit = (git_commit*)head_commit;",

Sometimes you\u2019re stuck on a project using another VCS, and wish it was Git. We\u2019ll spend the first part of this chapter learning about ways to use Git as a client when the project you\u2019re working on is hosted in a different system.\n\nAt some point, you may want to convert your existing project to Git. The second part of this chapter covers how to migrate your project into Git from several specific systems, as well as a method that will work if no pre-built import tool exists.\n\n# Git as a Client\n\nGit provides such a nice experience for developers that many people have figured out how to use it on their workstation, even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS. There are a number of these adapters, called \u201cbridges,\u201d available. Here we\u2019ll cover the ones you\u2019re most likely to run into in the wild.\n\n# Git and Subversion\n\nA large fraction of open source development projects and a good number of corporate projects use Subversion to manage their source code. It\u2019s been around for more than a decade, and for most of that time was the de facto VCS choice for open-source projects. It\u2019s also very similar in many ways to CVS, which was the big boy of the source-control world before that.\n\nOne of Git\u2019s great features is a bidirectional bridge to Subversion called git svn. This tool allows you to use Git as a valid client to a Subversion server, so you can use all the local features of Git and then push to a Subversion server as if you were using Subversion locally. This means you can do local branching and merging, use the staging area, use rebasing and cherry-picking, and so on, while your collaborators continue to work in their dark and ancient ways. It\u2019s a good way to sneak Git into the corporate environment and help your fellow developers become more efficient while you lobby to get the infrastructure changed to support Git fully. The Subversion bridge is the gateway drug to the DVCS world.\n\n# git svn\n\nThe base command in Git for all the Subversion bridging commands is git svn. It takes quite a few commands, so we\u2019ll show the most common while going through a few simple workflows.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that when you\u2019re using git svn, you\u2019re interacting with Subversion, which is a system that works very differently from Git. Although you can do local branching and merging, it\u2019s generally best to keep your history as linear as possible by rebasing your work, and avoiding doing things like simultaneously interacting with a Git remote repository.\n\nDon\u2019t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don\u2019t push to a parallel Git repository to collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time. Subversion can have only a single linear history, and confusing it is very easy. If you\u2019re working with a team, and some are using SVN and others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate \u2013 doing so will make",

You can work with local files, connect your repository to others over a network, and work effectively with others. But the story doesn\u2019t end there; Git is usually used as part of a larger ecosystem, and the terminal isn\u2019t always the best way to work with it. Now we\u2019ll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments where Git can be useful, and how other applications (including yours) work alongside Git.\n\n# Graphical Interfaces\n\nGit\u2019s native environment is in the terminal. New features show up there first, and only at the command line is the full power of Git completely at your disposal. But plain text isn\u2019t the best choice for all tasks; sometimes a visual representation is what you need, and some users are much more comfortable with a point-and-click interface.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that different interfaces are tailored for different workflows. Some clients expose only a carefully curated subset of Git functionality, in order to support a specific way of working that the author considers effective. When viewed in this light, none of these tools can be called \u201cbetter\u201d than any of the others, they\u2019re simply more fit for their intended purpose. Also note that there\u2019s nothing these graphical clients can do that the command-line client can\u2019t; the command-line is still where you\u2019ll have the most power and control when working with your repositories.\n\n# gitk and git-gui\n\nWhen you install Git, you also get its visual tools, gitk and git-gui.\n\ngitk is a graphical history viewer. Think of it like a powerful GUI shell over git log and git grep. This is the tool to use when you\u2019re trying to find something that happened in the past, or visualize your project\u2019s history.\n\nGitk is easiest to invoke from the command-line. Just cd into a Git repository, and type:\n\n$ gitk [git log options]\nGitk accepts many command-line options, most of which are passed through to the underlying git log action. Probably one of the most useful is the --all flag, which tells gitk to show commits reachable from any ref, not just HEAD. Gitk\u2019s interface looks like this:",

The JGit project is under the Eclipse umbrella, and its home can be found at https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/.\n\n# Getting Set Up\n\nThere are a number of ways to connect your project with JGit and start writing code against it. Probably the easiest is to use Maven \u2013 the integration is accomplished by adding the following snippet to the &lt;dependencies&gt; tag in your pom.xml file:\n\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.5.0.201409260305-r&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nThe version will most likely have advanced by the time you read this; check https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit for updated repository information. Once this step is done, Maven will automatically acquire and use the JGit libraries that you\u2019ll need.\n\nIf you would rather manage the binary dependencies yourself, pre-built JGit binaries are available from https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download. You can build them into your project by running a command like this:",

In this chapter, we\u2019ll see how you can make Git operate in a more customized fashion, by introducing several important configuration settings and the hooks system. With these tools, it\u2019s easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or your group needs it to.\n\n# Git Configuration\n\nAs you read briefly in Getting Started, you can specify Git configuration settings with the git config command. One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:\n\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n\nNow you\u2019ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize your Git usage.\n\nFirst, a quick review: Git uses a series of configuration files to determine non-default behavior that you may want. The first place Git looks for these values is in the system-wide [path]/etc/gitconfig file, which contains settings that are applied to every user on the system and all of their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\n\nThe next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig (or ~/.config/git/config) file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the --global option.\n\nFinally, Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you\u2019re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository, and represent passing the --local option to git config. If you don\u2019t specify which level you want to work with, this is the default.\n\nEach of these \u201clevels\u201d (system, global, local) overwrites values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig, for instance.\n\nGit\u2019s configuration files are plain-text, so you can also set these values by manually editing the file and inserting the correct syntax. It\u2019s generally easier to run the git config command, though.\n\n# Basic Client Configuration\n\nThe configuration options recognized by Git fall into two categories: client-side and server-side. The majority of the options are client-side \u2014 configuring your personal working preferences. Many, many configuration options are supported, but a large fraction of them are useful only in certain edge cases; we\u2019ll cover just the most common and useful options here. If you want to see a list of all the options your version of Git recognizes, you can run:",

The description file is used only by the GitWeb program, so don\u2019t worry about it. The config file contains your project-specific configuration options, and the info directory keeps a global exclude file for ignored patterns that you don\u2019t want to track in a .gitignore file. The hooks directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts, which are discussed in detail in Git Hooks.\n\nThis leaves four important entries: the HEAD and (yet to be created) index files, and the objects and refs directories. These are the core parts of Git. The objects directory stores all the content for your database, the refs directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more), the HEAD file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the index file is where Git stores your staging area information. You\u2019ll now look at each of these sections in detail to see how Git operates.\n\n# Git Objects\n\nGit is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.\n\nAs a demonstration, let\u2019s look at the plumbing command git hash-object, which takes some data, stores it in your .git/objects directory (the object database), and gives you back the unique key that now refers to that data object.\n\nFirst, you initialize a new Git repository and verify that there is (predictably) nothing in the objects directory:\n\n$ git init test\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/\n$ cd test\n$ find .git/objects\n.git/objects\n.git/objects/info\n.git/objects/pack\n$ find .git/objects -type f\nGit has initialized the objects directory and created pack and info subdirectories in it, but there are no regular files.

You can also create a zip archive in much the same way, but by passing the --format=zip option to git archive:\n\n$ git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip > `git describe master`.zip\nYou now have a nice tarball and a zip archive of your project release that you can upload to your website or email to people.\n\n# The Shortlog\n\nIt\u2019s time to email your mailing list of people who want to know what\u2019s happening in your project. A nice way of quickly getting a sort of changelog of what has been added to your project since your last release or email is to use the git shortlog command. It summarizes all the commits in the range you give it; for example, the following gives you a summary of all the commits since your last release, if your last release was named v1.0.1:\n\n$ git shortlog --no-merges master --not v1.0.1\nChris Wanstrath (6):\nAdd support for annotated tags to Grit::Tag\nAdd packed-refs annotated tag support.\nAdd Grit::Commit#to_patch\nUpdate version and History.txt\nRemove stray `puts`\nMake ls_tree ignore nils\nTom Preston-Werner (4):\nfix dates in history\ndynamic version method\nVersion bump to 1.0.2\nRegenerated gemspec for version 1.0.2\nYou get a clean summary of all the commits since v1.0.1, grouped by author, that you can email to your list.",

You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they\u2019ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.\n\nGit comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:\n\n1. [path]/etc/gitconfig file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.\n2. ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the --global option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on your system.\n3. config file in the Git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever repository you\u2019re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the --local option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.\n\nEach level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig.\n\nOn Windows systems, Git looks for the .gitconfig file in the $HOME directory (C:\\Users\\$USER for most people). It also still looks for [path]/etc/gitconfig, although it\u2019s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.

This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it\u2019s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:\n\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\nAgain, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.

A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things. So while it\u2019s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.\n\nThis chapter is about using GitHub effectively. We\u2019ll cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub\u2019s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.\n\nIf you are not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or to collaborate with other projects that are hosted on GitHub, you can safely skip to Git Tools.\n\n# Interfaces Change\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that like many active websites, the UI elements in these screenshots are bound to change over time. Hopefully the general idea of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here will still be there, but if you want more up to date versions of these screens, the online versions of this book may have newer screenshots.\n\n# Account Setup and Configuration\n\nThe first thing you need to do is set up a free user account. Simply visit https://github.com, choose a user name that isn\u2019t already taken, provide an email address and a password, and click the big green \u201cSign up for GitHub\u201d button.",

If you want more information on Libgit2 itself, there\u2019s API documentation at https://libgit2.github.com/libgit2, and a set of guides at https://libgit2.github.com/docs. For the other bindings, check the bundled README and tests; there are often small tutorials and pointers to further reading there.\n\n# JGit\n\nIf you want to use Git from within a Java program, there is a fully featured Git library called JGit. JGit is a relatively full-featured implementation of Git written natively in Java, and is widely used in the Java community. The JGit project is under the Eclipse umbrella, and its home can be found at https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/.\n\n# Getting Set Up\n\nThere are a number of ways to connect your project with JGit and start writing code against it. Probably the easiest is to use Maven \u2013 the integration is accomplished by adding the following snippet to the &lt;dependencies&gt; tag in your pom.xml file:\n\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.5.0.201409260305-r&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nThe version will most likely have advanced by the time you read this; check https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit for updated repository information. Once this step is done, Maven will automatically acquire and use the JGit libraries that you\u2019ll need.\n\nIf you would rather manage the binary dependencies yourself, pre-built JGit binaries are available from https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download. You can build them into your project by running a command like this:",

          "text": "# Git Internals\n\nYou may have skipped to this chapter from a much earlier chapter, or you may have gotten here after sequentially reading the entire book up to this point \u2014 in either case, this is where we\u2019ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. We found that understanding this information was fundamentally important to appreciating how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, we\u2019ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process. We leave it up to you to decide.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get started. First, if it isn\u2019t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You\u2019ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\n\nIn the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it\u2019s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.\n\nThe content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we\u2019ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you\u2019ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.\n\n# Plumbing and Porcelain\n\nThis book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as checkout, branch, remote, and so on. But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as Git\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called \u201cporcelain\u201d commands.\n\nAs you will have noticed by now, this book\u2019s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands. But in this chapter, you\u2019ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. Many of these commands aren\u2019t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.\n\nWhen you run git init in a new or existing directory, Git creates the .git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located. If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need. This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory. Here\u2019s what a newly-initialized .git directory typically looks like:\n\n$ ls -F1\nconfig\ndescription\nHEAD",
