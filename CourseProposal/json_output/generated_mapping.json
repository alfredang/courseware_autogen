        "SkillsFuture's report Skills Demand For The Future Economy (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport) published in 2025, spotlights the priority skills and jobs in demand in three specially selected, emerging, high-growth areas. This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore's key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of 'priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual's long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill's applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\nThe industry is currently facing several challenges and performance gaps that are directly related to the integration of generative AI in storytelling and storyboarding processes. One of the primary challenges is the rapid evolution of AI technologies, which has outpaced the ability of many professionals to effectively utilize these tools in their creative workflows. This has resulted in a gap between the potential capabilities of AI and the actual implementation in media production. Additionally, there is a significant challenge in ensuring the ethical use of AI, as biases in AI-generated content and issues related to copyright infringement are prevalent. The lack of comprehensive understanding and skills to address these ethical concerns can lead to legal and reputational risks for media companies. Furthermore, the creative industry is struggling with the balance between maintaining originality and leveraging AI-generated content, as there is a risk of producing generic and uninspired outputs if AI is not used creatively and strategically. These challenges highlight the need for targeted training to bridge the gap between current capabilities and the potential of AI in enhancing storytelling and storyboarding processes.\n\nTo address the challenges and performance gaps identified, there is a critical need for comprehensive training programs that focus on the integration of generative AI in storytelling and storyboarding. Such training should encompass a deep understanding of AI-generated script ideation techniques, including world-building, storyline, and character development. Additionally, it is essential to educate professionals on the limitations of AI tools and provide solutions to overcome these challenges, ensuring high-quality and creative outputs. Training should also emphasize the importance of ethical considerations, including awareness of bias in AI outputs and strategies to mitigate these issues. Understanding copyright laws and best practices to minimize plagiarism risk is crucial to avoid legal complications. Moreover, training should focus on enhancing the creative use of AI, encouraging professionals to incorporate unique storytelling elements and avoid generic replication. By equipping individuals with these skills and knowledge, the industry can better leverage AI technologies to produce innovative and compelling media content while maintaining ethical standards.\n\nSeveral job roles within the industry would significantly benefit from training in generative AI for storytelling and storyboarding. Scriptwriters and content creators are at the forefront of this transformation, as they are directly involved in developing narratives and scripts that can be enhanced through AI technologies. By understanding how to effectively use AI tools, these professionals can improve the quality and creativity of their work. Storyboard artists and visual designers would also benefit, as they can learn to integrate AI-generated images and videos into their workflows, enhancing the visual storytelling process. Additionally, roles such as media producers and directors can gain insights into how AI can streamline production processes and improve narrative consistency and clarity. Furthermore, legal and compliance professionals within media companies would benefit from understanding the ethical and legal implications of using AI, ensuring that their organizations adhere to copyright laws and ethical standards. Overall, training in generative AI for storytelling and storyboarding can empower a wide range of professionals within the industry to harness the full potential of AI technologies, leading to more innovative and ethically sound media content."
