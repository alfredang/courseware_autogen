    "K1": "Practical exercises assess the application of knowledge regarding scripts and tools, and their usage in software integration and deployment. It tests understanding of when and how to use specific tools.",
    "A1": "Practical exercises provide a direct demonstration of the ability to analyze release components. Assessing the practical application of identifying and understanding the different components of a release.",
    "K2": "Practical application tests the understanding of software configuration procedures by requiring candidates to execute these procedures, showing they understand each step's purpose and sequence.",
    "A2": "Practical exercises simulate real-world scenarios requiring coordination. Assessing the ability to communicate effectively and align release activities with stakeholders' needs and timelines.",
    "K3": "Configuration tests are included to check the candidate knows the configuration tests performed, and their purpose in ensuring the reliability and stability of the software product.",
    "A3": "Practical assessment demonstrates the ability to choose appropriate scripts and tools. Focusing on effectiveness and suitability for specific integration and deployment tasks, evaluating selection skills.",
    "K4": "Practical activities ensures the candidate can determine the outcome, issues or successes of testing procedures, and ensures the software is functional after configuration tests.",
    "A4": "Practical exercises test the ability to configure software. It assesses the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills in diverse platform configurations.",
    "K5": "The practical element ensures the candidate understands the software configuration and deployment process, and they have appropriate knowledge to perform actions that will be tested in action.",
    "A5": "Practical activities demonstrate competency in executing configuration tests. Assessing the ability to follow procedures accurately and efficiently, while understanding the expected outcomes.",
    "A6": "Practical tests involve identifying the cause and remedy to issues, which allows for assessment of their ability to diagnose effectively. The configuration allows a setting for practical investigation.",
    "A7": "Practical implementation allows for the ability to determine improvements from the outcome of testing, and their experience, which allows for better modification of software code.",
    "A8": "The practical element ensures the candidate can properly modify platform-specific software products and processes, while retaining previous functionality and applying improvements."
