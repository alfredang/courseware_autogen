            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "Many organizations struggle with coordinating software releases effectively, leading to delays and inconsistencies. This often stems from a lack of clear understanding of the components involved and poor synchronization between development teams and other stakeholders. This lack of coordination affects the speed and reliability of deployments.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course offers methods to break down release processes and align team efforts. By teaching how to assess project elements and encouraging greater communication, the training aims to streamline the entire software release lifecycle. This can reduce deployment bottlenecks and ensure that releases are more predictable and timely."
