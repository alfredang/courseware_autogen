        {
            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "One major challenge is the effective implementation of cloud solutions within existing IT environments. Organizations often lack a clear roadmap, leading to poorly configured systems and security vulnerabilities. Integrating existing on-premise infrastructure with the cloud poses significant difficulties, resulting in inefficiencies and increased operational costs.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course offers hands-on training in developing implementation plans. Participants will learn how to deploy and manage cloud resources. This knowledge equips them with the skills to streamline the integration process, secure cloud environments, and optimize resource utilization, leading to a more efficient and robust cloud infrastructure."
